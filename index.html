<article class="ArtKuni">Earlier today (september 27th, 2020) was an announcement made by Katsuhiro Harada and Micheal Murray. In this announcement was revealed that Kunimitsu would be reintroduced into the main series of Tekken, which hyped up many of us including myself. But the Kunimitsu who was revealed turned out to not be the Kunimitsu we knew as she repeatedly mentioned her mother, adding to that she didn't know Yoshimitsu until the moment they fought in the trailer. Later it was clarified by Harada and Murray that this Kunimitsu indeed wasn't the one all of us knew, Kunimitsu is apparently a title just as Yoshimitsu is in the Manji clan.
<br><br>
This Kunimitsu is the actual daughter of the Kunimitsu we all grew up with and loved. Kunimitsu has been revamped as a New Character for Tekken 7 with similar and new moves compared to her mother.
<br>
We are in for a ride with Kunimitsu and her original stage Vermillion Gates, which is based of typical Japanese architecture and nature showing off the beauty of Japan.
