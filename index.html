  Earlier today (november 7th, 2020) was the official launch trailer of Tekken 7 Season 4 released, right after the Tekken Online Challenge and Final Boss match had finished the trailer was dropped.
  The trailer revealed not only more of Kunimitsu's gameplay, but also different costumes. 
  After a long time waiting, finally we got to see the WiFi-indicator as well as the new UI. 
  It has been confirmed that this update will include the improved rollback netcode which many of us have been waiting for for years now. 
  The new Tekken God Omega rank and Tekken Prowess feature will be included in the first patch of the season 4 update.
  Yes, you read that right, season 4 will not have only 1 update but multiple updates!
  <br><br>
  Bandai Namco also have collaborated with the Pacman team to bring us Pacman themed cosmetics and a limited time Pacman themed stage to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the franchise. 
  Something none of us saw coming.
  <br><br>
  Finally, the release date has been revealed as well. 
  Only three days after today (november 7th, 2020) will we have access to season 4 and the season pass including the Pacman cosmetics and Kunimitsu DLC including her very own stage, Vermilion Gates.

  Earlier today (september 27th, 2020) was an announcement made by Katsuhiro Harada and Micheal Murray. 
  In this announcement was revealed that Kunimitsu would be reintroduced into the main series of Tekken, which hyped up many of us including myself. 
  But the Kunimitsu who was revealed turned out to not be the Kunimitsu we knew as she repeatedly mentioned her mother, adding to that she didn't know Yoshimitsu until the moment they fought in the trailer. 
  Later it was clarified by Harada and Murray that this Kunimitsu indeed wasn't the one all of us knew, Kunimitsu is apparently a title just as Yoshimitsu is in the Manji clan.
  <br><br>
  This Kunimitsu is the actual daughter of the Kunimitsu we all grew up with and loved. 
  Kunimitsu has been revamped as a New Character for Tekken 7 with similar and new moves compared to her mother.
  <br>
  We are in for a ride with Kunimitsu and her original stage Vermillion Gates, which is based of typical Japanese architecture and nature showing off the beauty of Japan.

  Kunimitsu I was one of the of the original cast of Tekken in 1994. 
  She proceeded to be featured in Tekken 2 as well where she'd be revamped and have her own playstyle rather than being just a clone of Yoshimitsu, who has been featured in every single Tekken game ever since Tekken. 
  Kunimitsu has made an appearance in Tekken, Tekken 2, Tekken Tag Tournament, Tekken Tag Tournament 2 and Tekken Revolution. 
  She has undergone a major revamp when she was added to Tekken Tag Tournament 2, Yoshimitsu and Kunimitsu still shared some moves but now Kunimitsu reallly became her own unique character separate from the others in the cast. 
  <br><br>
  Kunimitsu started out as a petty thief but later joined the Manji clan in order to hone her skills, the Manji Clan stole from the rich to give to the poor but she however had other things in mind and decided to steal from the Manji clan for her own good. 
  Yoshimitsu, the leader of the Manji Clan, was outraged and banished Kunimitsu from the clan. 
  Kunimitsu eventually ended up trying to steal the sword of Yoshimitsu which her grandfather wanted to replicate but never managed to replicate in his lifetime. 
  Kunimitsu however, lost the fight against Yoshimitsu.

  The video above demonstrates the evolution of Kunimitsu I up to her successor, her very own daughter, Kunimitsu II who will be in Tekken 7 this fall as a DLC character (DLC16). 
  Kunimitsu has gone through many phases despite the fact she made an appearance in less Tekken games than most characters on the roster. 
  <br><br>
  Now all we can do is eagerly wait for the official release of Kunimitsu II and see if she is anything like her mother, it's very likely Kunimitsu undergone another revamp but this time on a smaller scale. 
  Her design has already been revamped as this Kunimitsu is Kunimitsu II, but we've also seen that she's been revamped at least a little to fit in Tekken 7. 
  Only one question remains, what will the release date be for Kunimitsu II?
